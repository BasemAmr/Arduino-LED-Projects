## Shifting LEDs

The Shifting LEDs project involves controlling a string of 8 LEDs to simulate a shifting effect, where the LEDs move from one end to the other in a continuous loop.

## Flashing LEDs

In the Flashing LEDs project, the 8 LEDs flash on and off in a pattern, creating a visually striking effect.

## Ping Pong Game

The Ping Pong Game project utilizes the 8 LEDs to represent the movement of a virtual ping pong ball between two players, simulating the classic game on a physical board.

## Converging LEDs

With the Converging LEDs project, the 8 LEDs gradually converge towards the center point, creating an effect where the lights appear to meet at a single focal point.

## Diverging LEDs

In the Diverging LEDs project, the 8 LEDs spread outwards from a central point, creating an expanding pattern reminiscent of ripples in water or the dispersion of light.
